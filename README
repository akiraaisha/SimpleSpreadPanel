SSP (Simple Spread Panel)
=========================

This is a POC to demostrate how to inject binary files into a windows remote machines.

When I wrote this proof of concept in 2011, Microsoft and the idiots of its researchers, involved me in the legal process Zeus / SpyEye, according to them I was in charge of this inject banking Trojan in the internet, this is not true, it ruined my life, now I can not get job for this.

In this PDF http://www.zeuslegalnotice.com/images/Complaint_w_Appendices.pdf appears my old email jheto2002@gmail.com and say this text: Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereupon allege that John Doe 38 goes by the alias “jheto2002” and may be contacted at email address jheto2002@gmail.com. Upon information and belief, John Doe 38 is involved in creating injection code to deliver the Zeus/SpyEye code.

Because all things one pearson write this article on Forbes about me.

This project contains two subprojects, Banner and WebPanel, Banner is a simple java applet with a WSH dropper and WebPanel is a web app to injects binary files.

Sure, SSP are used to inject Zeus / SpyEye, you need are a big stupid to think this.
